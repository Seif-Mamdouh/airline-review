# airline-review
# Programmed a web-app to review and educate passengers about safety and cleanliness of flight during COVID-19 travels implementing a PostgreSQL database.
# Created a data model that contains name, slug and image URL for each airline; also created title, description, score and airline_id for the reviews model. 
# Stimulated fast_jsonapi to create the framework for the data to show in the API, and then use the data when we render json from within our controllers.
# Used HTTP library such as Axios to help to make requests to all my rails API to get the Airlines to show on the front-end and by adding UseEffect component, it       takes the response from the API request and use it to update our state to replace our empty airlines array with an array of the actual airline data from our database.
